### Mapty! I mean my Mapty :)

Through my journey with "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023" by Jonas Schmedtmann, the Mapty project was introduced: an application that allows you to map your workouts on an interactive map. You can log your running or cycling activities, record the distance, duration, speed, elevation...etc, and see your workout history on the map and control them.

And this is my version of Mapty with more advanced features.

### ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGIES I USED:
1. HTML, SASS, JS.
2. GEO Location API for detecting the user's current position.
3. Leaflet as a 3rd party library for the map.

Besides the main features that have been implemented in the course's version, this is a list of the features I've added:

<b>1. A more Interactive Form.</b><br/>
Unlike the old form used to appear in the workouts part, this new one directly appears on the map and has a "save" button and 3 ways to be closed (close icon, click outside, or "ESC" key), and provides a better user experience.

<b>2. Delete Workout.</b><br/>
Unlike the course's version, you can delete a workout.

<b>3. Remove All Workouts.</b><br/>
Unlike the course's version, you can remove all your saved workouts with one click.

<b>4. Responsive Designs.</b><br/>
Unlike the course's version, this version can work on different screen sizes.

These are the major updates and you can still find more by visiting the app.
